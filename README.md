How to use python and send automatic bulk emails

#### Initial configs:

Go to <a href = "https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833" >App passwords </a> and follow the instructions to create an app password  to your Google account. This will be necessary to allow the script to acces your account and send emails using it. 

This code can be easily customized. You just have to write your html or plain text email, depending on the desired output and the parts that you wish to 
customize, such as name, gender or an specific part of the content, can be later formated with the python `format()` function.

In this folder, a test csv and the script can be found!


#### Instructions to use the script:

Set you login, passaword (app password), sender, ccs and bcss on the code
